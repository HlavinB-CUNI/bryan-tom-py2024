# bryan-tom-py2024
Final Project for Bryan Hlavín and Tomasso Fazzi's Python Class at Charles University (Winter 2024)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository serves as the repository for the final project in the "Data Processing with Python - JEM207" class as instructed by Luboš Hanus. The topic of choice for this final project is "Olympic Games Medal Count Comparison".
Topic approved 28.11.2024.

The goal of this repository is to do the following: 

    1 Prompt the user, asking which Olympic games the user would like to start with (earliest) and end with (recent).
    2 The user inputs the years, returning not valid and to try again if a year is invalid.
    3 If a valid set of years, the program will determine automatically if the user wants summer games or winter games recorded.
    4 Program will then scrape every website necessary in the series (or individually) 
    5 The data from each website will be filtered accordingly, and inserted into a data fraome
    6 Data frame will be used to generate graphics for comparison between countries (graphics for rankings over the years, plot of average ranking throughout the years)
    7 Concluding statistics (medal count total, medal count average, etc.) will be printed
